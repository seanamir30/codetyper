**Improve your programming typing speed with real code snippets!**

CodeTyper is a specialized typing test designed specifically for programmers. Practice typing with actual code instead of random words and improve your coding efficiency across multiple programming languages.

## 🎯 Features

- **Multiple Programming Languages**: Practice with JavaScript, Python, Java, TypeScript, C++, and more
- **Real Code Snippets**: Type actual code patterns and syntax you use daily
- **Detailed Statistics**: Track your CPM (Characters Per Minute), accuracy, and progress
- **Customizable Durations**: Choose from 10 seconds to 5 minutes test sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes for extended coding sessions

## 🚀 Why CodeTyper?

Regular typing tests use random words, but as a programmer, you need to be fast with:
- Brackets `{}[]()` 
- Semicolons and special characters `;:"'`
- Indentation and code structure
- Programming language syntax
- Variable names and function calls

CodeTyper helps you practice what you actually type when coding!
